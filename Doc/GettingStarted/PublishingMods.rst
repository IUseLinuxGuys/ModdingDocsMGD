**Publishing Mods**
====================

After making a mod, the time-consuming part is over. But how and where you package your mod is an important step that shouldn't be neglected.
Without effort put into its presentation, a mod that a lot of players otherwise would've liked could go undiscovered.

**Packaging Your Mod**
-----------------------

Ensure you've attributed proper credit into a text file at least if you've used any royalty free assets, 
this is safe to include in your mod folder, as it will be ignored by the game.

When publishing updates for your mod, providing a changelog text file is also useful for people wanting to know what's been changed or added since they last played.

You will then need to compress the mod before uploading it to a file host. 
Make sure to distribute your mod as a normal ``.zip`` file. Not everyone will be able to extract a ``.rar`` or ``.7z`` file. 
See the instructions on how to make a zip file for your given platform:

.. tabs::

    .. tab:: Windows

        Right-click the folder of your mod to open, click "Send", and then click "Compressed (Zipped) Folder."

    .. tab:: macOS

        Hover the folder of your mod, control-click, right click, or tap it using two fingers, then choose Compress from the shortcut menu.
        If that renamed it to Archive.zip, be sure to rename it back to the name of your mod.

**File Hosting**
-----------------

Feel free to use others resources beyond the ones mentioned here, but keep in mind not all may be willing to host NSFW games. 
Other file hosts will often have information on their content policies at the bottom of their web pages.


* `Mega <https://mega.nz/start>`_ for its more than sufficient user-side download limit of 10 GB, and download speed. Features lifetime hosting, though users have had difficulties with this claim, including once MGD. It also requires an account to upload.
* `Anonfile <https://anonfile.com/>`_ has good download speed, file cap of 20 GB, and lifetime hosting. While it has yet to be used to host an MGD mod, there are plenty of other NSFW projects that have used this platform as their host, including MGD.
* `Github <https://github.com/>`_ doubles as a place for people to host their mod, and version control their work. Modders can share their releases page, and no link for the mod will ever become dated. While historically permissive of NSFW git projects, keep in mind their `use policies <https://docs.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-acceptable-use-policies>`_.
* The :ref:`MGDDiscord` can serve as a direct file host for mods up to 100 MB.

**Where To Share**
-------------------

It's highly encouraged to upload to the following places for optimal exposure for mods to the MGD community. 

Modders can also look for MGD forum threads on the internet to share their mod.

.. _MGDDiscord:

**MGD Discord**
""""""""""""""""

The MGD Discord can double as hosting *and* as a place to share mods. 
It's historically proven to make for a majority of mod downloads during first week or two of a mods launch.
The related modding channels on the server can also make for great help, discussion, and feedback for modders. 
If you want instantaneous exposure and player feedback for your creation, there is nowhere better to share your mod. 


Join the `MGD Discord <https://discord.com/invite/monstergirldreams>`_, upload your mod to the ``#mod-posting`` channel, 
and you can share the direct download link anywhere else you'd like to share your mod. 
The download link does not require users to open or login to Discord.

Alongside uploading your mod, it's recommended to provide a description and feature list of your mod in the channel, so people know what they're in for. Check the pins in the channel for a template and tips.

.. warning::

    Keep in mind the `Discord Community Guidelines <https://discord.com/guidelines>`_ 
    has limits to what content is allowed, which the MGD Discord server is no exception to.

    In particular, any content depicting minors in pornographic, sexually suggestive, or violent manner is not allowed, and will be removed. 
    This includes lolicon, shotacon, and cub characters.

    If you're uncertain if your mod is crossing the line, you're free to Direct Message the Moderators on the server.

**MGD Wiki**
"""""""""""""

The Mod List on the `wiki <https://monstergirldreams.miraheze.org/wiki/Category:List_Of_Mods>`_ will make up for a majority of downloads for a mod in the long run. 
Its list is automatically generated from new wiki pages contributed by mod authors, aggregating from information they provide on their respective pages.

See the "Making & Adding Mods" tab in the How-To Guides section on the page to begin making a mod page. It does not require an account, and comes with a template and example for modders to follow.

.. warning::

    Keep in mind the `Miraheze content policies <https://meta.miraheze.org/wiki/Content_Policy>`_
    when uploading your mod.

    Like the MGD Discord, any content depicting minors in pornographic, sexually suggestive, or violent manner is not allowed, and will be removed. 
    This includes lolicon, shotacon, and cub characters.

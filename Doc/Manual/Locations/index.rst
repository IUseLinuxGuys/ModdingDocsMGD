**Locations** 
==============

Locations are spots on the game map when you select "Go Adventuring!" from the town, defining their icon, adventure, and Grimoire details. 
Note the town itself is hard-coded, and thus isn't modded like you would other existing locations. 
Instead, mods can access the town by creating Event JSONs.

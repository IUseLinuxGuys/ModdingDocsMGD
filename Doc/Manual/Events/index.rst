**Events** 
===========

Events encompass the vast number of scenes and moments within the game. They are near all instances of the text you read in the textbox at the bottom of the game screen, including things the player doesn't see, such as scene jump logic, altering music or images, or calling stat checks. Events are even used during combat encounters when just a Skill JSON is too simple. An example would be the blue slime asking if you are okay with anal insertion.

.. _Choice:

**Choice**
===========

.. tip::

  See :ref:`Get Event Choice` for Choice functions outside of the given file.

**SetChoice**
--------------
Will set specified choice number to the following string value. Think of them as numerically organized flag markers you can set for an event, not as variables.

::

  "SetChoice", "1", "Stole the panty"

**IfChoice**
-------------
Will check for a choice. If the choice number's possible string value is a match to the stored value, it then goes to the specified scene.
If it is not a match, it will ignore the scene jump and continue the scene.

::

  "IfChoice", "1", "Stole the panty", "PlayerGoesToHornyJail"

By default, all ``"SetChoice"`` functions not yet triggered by the player exist as blank strings ``""``, which can be checked for.

.. _ChoiceToDisplay:

**ChoiceToDisplayPlayer and ChoiceToDisplayMonster**
-----------------------------------------------------
``"ChoiceToDisplayPlayer"`` & ``ChoiceToDisplayMonster`` grabs the specified choice's string value for
the :ref:`Text Markup` specified below, and is not reset until it is called again, so it will affect other events. Thus, it should be called at the start
of an event.

Both are exactly the same, each function simply titled with the intention as either being used for setting a nickname for the player or monster. Or even
giving the Monster a different name in dialogue, say, giving a generic monster in an event an actual name. They could be used for other purposes.


::

  "ChoiceToDisplayPlayer", "1"

``{DisplayPlayerChoice}`` and ``{DisplayMonsterChoice}`` in :ref:`Event Text Markup` is the markup to utilize the functions.

.. _SetChoiceToPlayerName:

**SetChoiceToPlayerName**
--------------------------
Sets the selected choice to the playerâ€™s name. For the above functions intended use case.

::

  "SetChoiceToPlayerName", "1"

``"SetChoiceTo PlayerName"`` also exists if you want a space at the start of the displayed choice.

::

  "SetChoiceTo PlayerName", "1"

See :ref:`SetChoiceToPlayerNameFromOtherEvent` for setting a choice to an external event.

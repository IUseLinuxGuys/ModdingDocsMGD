**Quest, Event, Adventure Complete**
=====================================

**QuestComplete**
------------------

``"QuestComplete"`` makes an event no longer selectable via the Grimoire. Despite its name, it covers the entire :ref:`Grimoire` section of :ref:`CardType`, so both Quests, *and* Events in the Grimoire.

.. tip:: You can still jump or call to the event via other functions.

**AdventureComplete**
----------------------

``"AdventureComplete"`` makes an adventure no longer selectable via the map. This affects the adventure for any locations it is listed in.

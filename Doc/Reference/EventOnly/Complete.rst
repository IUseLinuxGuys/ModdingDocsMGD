**Quest & Event Complete**
===========================

**QuestComplete**
------------------
``"QuestComplete"`` makes an event no longer selectable via the Grimoire. Despite its name, it covers the entire :ref:`Grimoire` section of :ref:`CardType`, so both Quests, *and* Events in the Grimoire.

.. tip:: You can still jump or call to the event via other functions.

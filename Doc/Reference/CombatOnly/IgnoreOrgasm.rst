.. _DenyCombatOrgasm:

**DenyTargetOrgasm and DenyAttackerOrgasm**
================================================

``"DenyTargetOrgasm"`` makes the target of an attack immune to normal orgasm calls
(e.g. ``"PlayerOrgasm"`` and ``"MonsterOrgasm"`` still works) for a single attack, resetting thereafter.
This does mean the target can still orgasm from recoil.

``"DenyAttackerOrgasm"`` specifically exists for letting the attacker avoid recoil damage triggering an orgasm.

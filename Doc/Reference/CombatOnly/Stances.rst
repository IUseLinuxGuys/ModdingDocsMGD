**Stances**
============

.. tip::
    See :ref:`Stance Reference` for information on the stances featured in the game.

**ApplyStance**
----------------
Applies the stance to the player and the currently focused monster.
Be sure to have a check for stance before this so you donâ€™t reapply the stance a second time. Or more.

::

  "ApplyStance", "Kissing"

Note that out of combat stance calls, as well as :ref:`Counters` and :ref:`EndOfRound` calls need to have the skill manually set for the fetish check.
Or else, it may use the players skill for the fetish application to stance durability. This done be done via the sub-function ``"SetAttack"``.

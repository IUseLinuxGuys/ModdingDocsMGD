    array
        Arrays are when you can provide multiple :term:`values` in a single key. They are surrounded by square brackets ``[]``. For example:

        .. code-block:: javascript

            ["Item One", "Item Two", "Item Three"]

    values
        Values in MGD are anything between strings, between two double quote ``""`` marks. For example:

        .. code-block:: javascript

        "Key": "A String Value."

        Numbers values are always provided inside strings as well.

    array
        Arrays are when you can provide multiple string values to a key. They are surrounded by square brackets ``[]``. For example:

        .. code-block:: javascript

            ["Item One", "Item Two", "Item Three"]

        The documentation for a key will mention and demonstrate whether it accepts using an array.

    values
        Values are anything inside strings, which is anything between two double quote ``""`` marks and no ending colon ``:``. For example:

        .. code-block:: javascript

            "Key": "A String Value."

        Numbers values are always provided inside strings as well.

        This is the staple of providing any value in MGD, even number values are inside strings.

    key
        Keys are anything between two double quote ``""`` marks followed by a colon ``:``. They must always be inside an object, which is a pair of curly braces ``{}``. For example:

        .. code-block:: javascript
        
            {
                "Key":
            }
        
        You **never** will make your own custom key while modding MGD, only use existing ones. Stick to the blank templates and what the modding docs detail!

    object
        Objects are two curly braces, containing strictly keys, which is anything between two double quote ``""`` marks followed by a colon ``:``. For example:
        
        .. code-block:: javascript
        
            {
                "Key":
